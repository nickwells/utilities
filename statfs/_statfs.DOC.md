# statfs

Report on the status of file systems\.

By default the file system to be reported will be that of the current directory
&apos;\.&apos; but you can specify a list of alternative directories by passing
them after the terminating parameter \(&apos;\-\-&apos;\)\. The value reported
will be the available space\.

## Parameters

This uses the `param` package and so it has access to the help parameters
which give a comprehensive message describing the usage of the program and
the parameters you can give. The `-help` parameter on its own will print the
standard parameters that the program can accept but you can also give
parameters to show both more or less help, in more or less detail. Other
standard parameters allow you to explore where parameters have been set and
where they can be set. The description of the `-help` parameter is a good
place to start to explore the help available.

The intention of the `param` package is to provide complete documentation
for the program from the command line.
