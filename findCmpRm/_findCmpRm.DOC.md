# findCmpRm

This finds any files in the given directory \(by default: \.\) with the given
extension \(by default: \.orig\)\. It presents each file and gives the user the
chance to compare it with the corresponding file without the extension\. The
user is then asked whether to remove the file with the extension\. The command
name echoes this: find, compare, remove\. You will also have the opportunity to
revert the file back to the original contents\.

## Parameters

This uses the `param` package and so it has access to the help parameters
which give a comprehensive message describing the usage of the program and
the parameters you can give. The `-help` parameter on its own will print the
standard parameters that the program can accept but you can also give
parameters to show both more or less help, in more or less detail. Other
standard parameters allow you to explore where parameters have been set and
where they can be set. The description of the `-help` parameter is a good
place to start to explore the help available.

The intention of the `param` package is to provide complete documentation
for the program from the command line.
