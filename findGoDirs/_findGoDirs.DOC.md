# findGoDirs

This will search for directories containing Go packages\. You can add extra
criteria for selecting the directory\. Once in each selected directory you can
perform certain actions\. If no directory is given then the current directory is
searched\. Directories called testdata or with names starting with either
&apos;\.&apos; or &apos;\_&apos; are ignored\. Duplicate directory names are
silently removed\.

## Parameters

This uses the `param` package and so it has access to the help parameters
which give a comprehensive message describing the usage of the program and
the parameters you can give. The `-help` parameter on its own will print the
standard parameters that the program can accept but you can also give
parameters to show both more or less help, in more or less detail. Other
standard parameters allow you to explore where parameters have been set and
where they can be set. The description of the `-help` parameter is a good
place to start to explore the help available.

The intention of the `param` package is to provide complete documentation
for the program from the command line.
